The key point to understand is how to use the configuration file that is read by the log4j library. This file is located at `src/main/resources/log4j.properties`\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"play-skeleton\">Play MVC</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java & Scala\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of creating an MVC application using the Play framework.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Perhaps the most easy to use/configure MVC framework out there. To run the application, you need to have Play installed and available on the classpath. Once installed, checkout the project, and while standing inside the directory of the `PlayHelloWorld`, run the command `play` and you will enter inside the play terminal. Next, just type in `run` and play will compile and deploy your application on an embedded jetty server and you can view your application using the url `http://localhost:9000` or `http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld` (routes have been set for both URLs)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"axis2-ws\">Axis2 Webservice</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of creating an XML SOAP web service using Axis2. Note that this is just a web service implementation, to consume the web service, use any web service client like SOAPUI or you can create your own.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** To run the project, checkout and deploy the war on tomcat7 application server. The wsdl will be available at the URL `http://localhost:8080/AxisWebserviceHelloWorld/services/CalculatorService?wsdl`. \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"ejb-hw\">EJBs</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of how to create, deploy and then retrieve a stateless session bean using the EJBs API via JNDI.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** There are two parts on how to execute the project. First we need to build the project with `mvn clean install`. Next, copy the built war file into the deployements folder for the application server (project has been optimized and tested against wildfly8.2). Once deployed, now we need to retrieve this EJB via JNDI. For this, run the main method in the class `com.sample.client.StandAloneClient`. You can see the logs printed in the server logs. \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"jpa-hibernate\">JPA using Hibernate ORM</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic workflow of how to implement the Hibernate implementation of JPA. Hibernate is one of the powerfull, scalable, flexible and most used ORM framework used in the software industry. To understand the difference between JPA and Hibernate, the best possible description is the statement; \"JPA is the dance and Hibernate is the dancer\".\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and execute the MainRunner class that is located inside the package `com.main`. The application uses HSQLDB(http://hsqldb.org/) for carrying out CRUD operations so no DB is requiered to run the program, although you can direct it to your Database by simply changing the `hibernate.connection.url` in `hibernate.cfg.xml`. This is the configuration file used by hibernate to connect to your DB.  \r\n\r\n## <a name=\"jsoup-html\">Jsoup HTML parser</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** A dummy implementation of the Jsoup library to parse html documents.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and execute the command `mvn clean test`. Basic parsing have been implemented as Junit cases. Also there is a main method in the class `com.sample.one.MainRunner` that shows how to parse and retreive information via Jsoup for a particualr Html page on the web\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"spark-mvc\">Spark MVC</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java (JDK8)\r\n\r\n**Description:** A skeleton implementation of an MVC application using the Spark framework. Another simple and easy to implement MVC framework that can be used to expose a set of REST calls quick and easy. Comes with an embedded server so no deployment is required.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and execute the command `mvn clean test`. Then simply run the main method located at `com.sampl.main.MainRunner` and the server will load up at `localhost:4567`. Navigate to the URL `localhost:4567/helloWorld` and you will see the logs in the console as well as a sample text being returned from the exposed method\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"servlet30-mvc\">Servlet/JSP</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of an MVC architecture based on raw Servlets and JSPs. \r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and execute the command `mvn clean install`. Deploy the generated war file in any application server (Tomcat 7) and then navigate to the page `http://localhost:8080/Servlet30HelloWorld/helloServlet` and you will be greeted with a message from a compiled JSP.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"applet-hw\">Applets</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of a java applet. \r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project compile the class at the root of the project using the command `javac MyFirstApplet.java`.

You need atleast a single node Hadoop cluster already setup before running this example.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and run `mvn clean install` to build the jar. Once jar is built, copy it to the Hadoop cluster and execute the command `hadoop jar MapReduceHelloWorld-0.0.1.jar com.sample.client.ClientRunner /test_data/a_sample_file.csv output`. The result of the word count will be written in the output directory on the configured HDFS.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"springboot-hw\">SpringBoot</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Java (JDK8)\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of an MVC structure and web services using Spring Boot\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and run `mvn spring-boot:run` to run the main method. Once ready, open the browser and navigate to the page `http://localhost:8080` and the greeting message will be printed on the screen. For parameter based web service, hit the url `http://localhost:8080/hello?name=John` and the paramter will be passed to the controller and greeting message for John will be printed on the browser.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"py-unit\">pyUnit</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** Python\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of how to create unit tests for python2.7 using the built-in unit test library for the python language. \r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project to any directory and on the command prompt type `python cal_test.py` and it will execute the test cases and the result status of all the test cases will be displayed on the terminal\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"dotnet-ws\">.NET WebService</a> [&#8593;](#list-index)\r\n**Language:** .NET Framework 4.0 (Non maven based)\r\n\r\n**Description:** Basic implementation of creating a simple SOAP web service using .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n**How to run:** Checkout the project and deploy it.
