The project is open for contributions from everyone. If you want to contribute to the project, the best way is to

- Check the issues page to see if any pending issue is left and fixable
- Fork the repo
- Add documented and tested code
- Open a pull request to the master branch

Once reviewed, the pull request will be merged
README.md will contain information of runnable projects ONLY. All other projects are either in dev or testing phase and such projects are not to be relied on yet.
Its always best to open a issue and discuss its possibility before writing up the code. I am always open for suggestions. Feel free to contact me or contribute to the project.
